In order to use extended features like [Sass](plugins/scss) or modify default behaviors, you can use Pencel's CLI.

The CLI provides simple access and configuration to Pencel's core build processor. The CLI will read a configuration file (`pencel.config.ts`) in the root of your project to determine which plugins and options to enable.

To get started, you first need to install the Pencel CLI as a development dependency:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install -D @pencel/cli
````

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add -D @pencel/cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add -D @pencel/cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun add -D @pencel/cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, create a `pencel.config.ts` file in the root of your project. The configuration below sets overrides the default tag namespace for your project:

import pencelConfig from '../../../../../examples/sample/web/pencel.config.ts?raw';

<Code code={pencelConfig} lang="json" title="pencel.config.ts" />

The full configuration reference can be found in the [API documentation](https://github.com/max-scopp/pencel/blob/main/packages/core/src/compiler/types/config-types.ts#L22).

#### Supported Configuration formats

Pencel is using [`c12`](https://github.com/unjs/c12) under the head and all configuration formats supported by `c12` are supported by Pencel as well.
However, it is highly recommended to use `pencel.config.ts` with `defineConfig` to get the best DX and type safety.

## Adopting to your Build System

Right now, you can only use Pencel's CLI to generate your components. 
In the future, Pencel may provide plugins and integrations for popular build systems.

The simplest way to integrate Pencel into your build process is to add a script in your `package.json` that runs the Pencel CLI before your build step.

```diff lang="json"
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
+    "generate": "pencel",
+    "generate:watch": "pencel --watch"
  },
}
```

### Adoption in Nx

If you're using [Nx](https://nx.dev/), you can use [Command Chaining](https://nx.dev/docs/reference/nx/executors#chaining-commands) in parallel.

```json
"serve": {
    "executor": "nx:run-commands",
    "options": {
        "commands": [
          "vite dev",
          "pencel --watch",
        ],
        "parallel": true
    }
}
```
