Pencel is designed to be build-agnostic and framework-friendly, taking a different approach from traditional Web Component compilers.

## Build Process & Runtime

    subgraph "Build Time"
        CLI[CLI Entry Point] --> Compiler[Compiler Core]
        Compiler --> TSAnalysis[TypeScript Analysis]
        Compiler --> MetaExtractor[Metadata Extraction]
        Compiler --> CodeGen[Code Generation]

        UserBuild --> UserBundle[User Bundler]

    end
```

## Key Differences from Other Tools

Unlike traditional compilers that provide their own compilation pipeline, Pencel:

- Works with any build system
- Outputs pure TypeScript source code
- No enforced bundler or dev server
- No automatic polyfills
