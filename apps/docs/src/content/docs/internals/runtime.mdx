Pencel's runtime is a lightweight JSX-compatible system focused on efficient rendering and diffing operations. It provides a minimal API that maintains compatibility with familiar JSX patterns while offering a clean, focused approach.

## Core Components

The runtime consists of several key components:

- **Component Runtime**: Manages component lifecycle and state
- **Virtual DOM**: Handles efficient rendering and updates
- **Property System**: Manages reactive properties
- **Event System**: Handles custom event dispatch and listening
- **Lifecycle Manager**: Controls component lifecycle hooks
