**Legend:** ✅ Working | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not started

## Zero-VDOM Architecture

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| JSX to AST parsing | ❌ | Parse component JSX into analyzable AST |
| Compile-time codegen | ❌ | Generate optimized update functions from AST |
| Compile-time diffing | ❌ | Generate update code for changed properties |
| Direct DOM instructions | ❌ | Eliminate VDOM overhead |
| Event binding compilation | ❌ | Resolve event listeners at compile-time |

## Core Pipeline

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Program | ✅ | File discovery & tsconfig validation |
| SourceFiles | ✅ | In-memory file registry |
| FileProcessor | ✅ | IR building from AST |
| IRRI | ✅ | IR tracking by kind |
| Transformers | ✅ | AST synchronization |
| SourcePrinter | ✅ | AST to source code |
| FileWriter | ⚠️ | Only writes ir.json; needs `writeAllFiles()` |

## Plugin System

| Hook | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `onGenerate` | ❌ | Global file generation (ir.json, d.ts) |
| `onDerive` | ❌ | Per-source framework adapters |
| Import Resolution | ❌ | Missing `resolveImports()` & validation |
| Sync AST Phase | ❌ | Cross-file type resolution |

## Testing Gaps

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| FileProcessor with various component patterns | ❌ | Unit tests |
| IRRI batching by kind | ❌ | Unit tests |
| Import resolution validation | ❌ | Integration tests |
| FileWriter + SourcePrinter integration | ❌ | Integration tests |
| Incremental compilation with watch mode | ❌ | Integration tests |
