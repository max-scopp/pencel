You can extend Pencel with custom plugins to add project-specific transformations, code generation, or integration with external tools.

<Aside type="caution">
The plugin API is still in early development. Expect breaking changes in future releases. Use with caution in production.

## Creating a Custom Plugin

Custom plugins are configured as objects in your `pencel.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@pencel/core';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    {
      name: 'my-custom-plugin',
      // Plugin implementation goes here
    }
  ]
});
```

## Plugin Lifecycle

Plugins hook into the compiler at specific points:

- **setup** – Called when the plugin is initialized
- **generate** – Called to generate global files from the complete IR
- **derive** – Called to generate per-source outputs (framework adapters)
- **teardown** – Called when compilation completes

## Next Steps

For advanced plugin development, see the [compiler architecture documentation](/pencel/internals/compiler) and study the built-in plugins in the Pencel repository.
