2026 is mainly about making the core rock solid before touching any extras.
First I need to settle the VDOM decision (stick with mine or switch to
[Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom)) and finish the IR so
output targets feel natural to write.

Once the foundation is stable, I’ll tighten up the component model: proper props,
state, events, decorators, and lifecycle. After that comes slots and projection
— the part that usually breaks weaker runtimes.

Only then do React and Angular ship. DX polish comes afterward if needed.

**Priority list:**

- Finalize VDOM choice
- Finish component IR
- Props/State/Events + namespace-aware tags
- `@Watch`, `@Method`, `@Element` + lifecycle hooks
- Slots, CSS custom props, form association
- Ship `@pencel/react` and `@pencel/angular`
