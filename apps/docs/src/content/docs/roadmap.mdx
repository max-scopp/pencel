2026 is mainly about making the core rock solid before touching any extras.
First I need to settle the VDOM decision (stick with mine or switch to
[Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom)) and finish the IR so
output targets feel natural to write.

Once the foundation is stable, I'll tighten up the component model: proper props,
state, events, decorators, and lifecycle. After that comes slots and projection
— the part that usually breaks weaker runtimes.

Only then do React and Angular ship. DX polish comes afterward if needed.

**Priority list:**

- Finalize VDOM choice
- Finish component IR
- Props/State/Events + namespace-aware tags
- `@Watch`, `@Method`, `@Element` + lifecycle hooks
- Slots, CSS custom props, form association
- Ship `@pencel/react` and `@pencel/angular`

### Update — 2025-10-25

Pencel is moving to a **zero-VDOM architecture**, similar to Svelte's compile-time model.
Instead of diffing a virtual tree at runtime, Pencel will statically analyze each component's render logic and generate direct DOM update instructions.

This eliminates the VDOM layer entirely, cutting runtime overhead and making Pencel components effectively as fast and small as hand-written vanilla Web Components.

The tradeoff is a shift in the component model: reactivity and state will be handled at compile-time instead of via a VDOM runtime. It's a large change — but one that unlocks performance levels no WC library currently achieves.
