## The Problem

The component ecosystem has fragmented into isolated silos:

- **Stencil** – Enterprise tooling trapped in outdated compilation models
- **Mitosis** – Powerful multi-framework generation, but template-based and fragile
- **Lit** – Developer-friendly Web Components, but no framework integrations
- **Framework-specific tools** – React/Vue/Angular components don't share code

You're forced to choose: either rebuild components for each framework, or accept tight coupling to one ecosystem. **Pencel solves this.**

## How Pencel Is Different

**Zero-VDOM Compilation** (inspired by Svelte)  
Pencel parses JSX into an AST and generates direct element creation code—no JSX runtimes, no virtual DOM overhead. Web Components have minimal performance impact, making them perfect for any framework without abstraction costs.

**IR-Driven Architecture**  
Unlike template-driven tools (Mitosis), Pencel uses an Intermediate Representation system that enables powerful, fine-grained code generation. Your source code stays clean, and you're not locked into predefined conventions.

**Web Components First, Framework Bindings Second**  
Your components compile to standard Web Components, then optionally to React, Angular, or Vue wrappers. This means:
- Load your library once via CDN and use across multiple frameworks
- Share a unified component core in mixed-framework applications
- Reduced bundle size—components load once, not duplicated per island
- Future-proof with the Web Components standard

**TypeScript Decorators You Know**  
Familiar API from Stencil (`@Component`, `@Prop`, `@Event`) with modern TypeScript 5+ features and zero magic.

## ✅ Pencel Is For You If

- **Building design systems or component libraries** used across multiple frameworks
- **Islands architecture or multi-framework applications** with shared components
- **Want Web Components as your core** with framework bindings as adapters
- **Need compiler flexibility** for custom enterprise pipelines
- **Deploying across web, desktop (Tauri), or mobile** with shared design systems at near-native performance
- **Tired of rebuilding components** for each framework you support

## ❌ Pencel May Not Be the Right Fit If

- Building a **single-framework application** (React, Vue, or Angular only)
- **No existing build tooling**—Pencel requires Vite, Webpack, or esbuild
- Need **highly framework-specific integrations** beyond standardized patterns
- **Early-stage prototyping** without modern build infrastructure
